# Code Refactored

## In order to ensure a proper project workflow, elements must be organized into an easily legible and adjustable manner. In this updated code, I took selectors, classes, and ids and combined or deleted them without losing the original site's appearance or overall functionality. Refactoring is essential to every website because uneccesary code can hamper debugging should an issue arise, and it can also make uniform or site-wide changes smoother.
